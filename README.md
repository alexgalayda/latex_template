# latex_template
Docker container with my latex templates

This is my template for generating latech documents. It can be used both directly and as a submodule. If using it as a submodule, before using it, use `run.sh`

To start building a document using docker-compose: `make` or `make compose`

To start building a document on your local machine: `make build`

To show: `make run`

To clean: `make clear`
